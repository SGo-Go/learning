[^footnote-copyright]: (c) [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham), Jason Zweig (2003) *[The Intelligent Investor](graham_ii)*: The Definitive Book on Value Investing

## Foreword

> What's needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.

<!-- > Whether you achieve outstanding results will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your investments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that prevail during your investing career.
