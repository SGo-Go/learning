# Chapter I

Complex numbers **history**:
- XVI [Bombelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Bombelli) (1579) *L'Algebra*:
  multiplication and addition rules (discovered in symbolic form)
  <details><summary>(c) Needham, Tristan (1997) VCA</summary>

  - > The power and beauty of complex analysis ultimately springs from the multiplication rule (2) in conjunction with the addition rule (1).
  -  > It was not the quadratic that forced complex numbers to be taken seriously, it was the *cubic* $x^3 = 3 p x + 2 q$.

  </details>
- XVIII-XIX [Wessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Wessel) (1799),
  [Argand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Robert_Argand) (1806),
  and [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#Analysis) (1831):
  *geometric interpretation* as points (or vectors) in the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane)
  (complex plane, or Argand diagram, or Gauss plane)

Common **ways of labelling** complex numbers:
- Cartesian coordinates
- polar coordinates
- ["stereographic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane#Stereographic_projections) coordinates

  $x^n - 1$ & $n$-gons ([$n$-th roots of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity)))
