## Foreword

> Mathematical reality exists outside the confines of space and time, but books about mathematics do not. 

> Our abstract mathematical notion of a “real number” remains aloof from any such realities of the actual world. Yet, in a curious reversal of roles, it is this very mathematical idealization that underlies most of our theories of the actual world.

<!-- > It is not a written law, and those who flout it may yet prosper, but it says, *Mathematics must not be visualized*!... This reflects the fact that steadily over the last hundred years the honour of visual reasoning in mathematics has been besmirched. Although the great mathematicians have always been oblivious to such fashions, it is only recently that the “mathematician in the street” has picked up the gauntlet on behalf of geometry. -->

<!-- > My book will no doubt be flawed in many ways of which I am not yet aware, but there is one “sin” that I have intentionally committed, and for which I shall not repent: many of the arguments are not rigorous, at least as they stand. This is a serious crime if one believes that our mathematical theories are merely elaborate mental constructs, precariously hoisted aloft. Then rigour becomes the nerve-racking balancing act that prevents the entire structure from crashing down around us. -->
> But suppose one believes, as I do, that our mathematical theories are attempting to capture aspects of a robust Platonic world that is not of our making. I would then contend that an initial lack of rigour is a small price to pay if it allows the reader to see into this world more directly and pleasurably than would otherwise be possible.

## Chapter 1

<!-- > The root cause of all this trouble seems to have been a psychological or philosophical block. How could one investigate these matters with enthusiasm or confidence when nobody felt they knew the answer to the question, “What is a complex number?” A Satisfactory answer to this question was only found at the end of the eighteenth century”. -->

<!-- > It is valuable to grasp from the outset that (according to the geometric view) a complex number is *a single, indivisible entity* -- a point in the plane. Only when we choose to describe such a point with numerical coordinates does a complex number appear to be compound or “complex”. -->

> In order to explain Euler's formula we must first address the more basic question, “What does $e^{i \theta}$ *mean*?” Surprisingly, many authors answer this by defining $e^{i \theta}$, out of the blue, to be $\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. This gambit is logically unimpeachable, but it is also a low blow to Euler, reducing one of his greatest achievements to a mere tautology.
