# [Temple Grandin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin) Approach to Educating Aspies

## Tips

**TG's Adapting Strategy**:
1. Focus on the problem

   <details><summary>Examples</summary>

   - Problems making friends? $\implies$
     1. *special interest group* (scouting, [4H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-H), or a model rocket club)
   - Not talking? $\implies$
     1. *evidence-based treatments* (e.g., ABA-type therapy) + 20 h/week with an effective teacher
     2. be observant to identify *biological* or *sensory* issues.
   - Behavior problems? $\implies$
     1. look for *causes* (medical, sensory)
     2. be aware of *manipulation*
     3. have *consistent rules* at school and home
     4. provide a *safe place* and give *time* for tuning out
   - Sensory issues? (range: irritating $\to$ totally debilitating; no single solution) $\implies$
     1. contact an occupational therapist
     2. try different things to see what works
   - Problems with bullying?
     1. *special interest groups*
     2. (if worse came worst) consider virtual schooling, home schooling, and other options

   </details>

2. Develop and build on abilities and strengths
   - detect type of thinking (usually shows up by 3rd or 4th grade)
   - emphasize developing the area of strength:
     - let more advanced lessons 
     - provide mentors (e.g., retired scientists)
   - find accommodations that *enable but do not overprotect* and shelter
   - try a *variety of learning approaches* and use the method that works
3. Be consistent
   - communicate as a team

     <details>

     (all[^ALL_INVOLVED]) must be *on the same page* regarding therapy, problems, rules and their consequences
     > It takes a village to raise a child. (Eustacia Cutler, TG’s mother)

     </details>

   - be consistent
     - *establish rules* and follow through on them *with consequences*
     - (all[^ALL_INVOLVED]) follow *licensed therapists*
    - think bottom up
      - *find out the cause* (medical problem or sensory overload). Usually, pain, stress, frightening. 

4. Stretch them (outside their comfort zones)
   - give *choices* (smartly)

     <details><summary>Examples</summary>

     - choice to go for short or for long time, but staying at home is not an option

     </details>

   - teach *social skills*

     <details><summary>Examples</summary>

     - practice shaking hands and greeting people
     - learn how to introduce himself or herself

     </details>

   - teach life skills and *give responsibilities*

     <details><summary>Examples</summary>

     - practice ordering food (start at home, them slightly move to ordering at a restaurant)
     - practice buying groceries

     </details>

   - *broaden* out their *skills and interests*

5. Get real world experience (learn working skills)

   - *start early* with job skills
   
     <details><summary>Ideas</summary>

     - middle school
       - doing chores
       - walking dogs
     - teens
       - building or maintaining websites
       - retails
       - unqualified work on a farm or plant, etc
     - all ages
       - find hands-on and/or problem-solving classes (like cooking, sewing, woodshop, or welding)
    
     </details>
   
   - get *creative*
     <!-- What needs doing in your school or neighborhood? Where can your teen help? -->
   - *use your network*
     <!-- Jobs rarely fall in anyone’s lap. Call on your family, friends, and community. -->
   - find *real work*
     <!-- aspeis know when they are being asked to do fake work. -->

[^ALL_INVOLVED]: parents, educators (i.e., teachers, mentors, etc), caregivers, therapists, etc

## Categorization of aspies (according to TG)

By **Types of Thinking**:
- Photo Realistic Visual Thinker
  - characteristics: associative, not linear 
  -  learning approach: bottom-up (animal-like, specific)
    - give bunch of specific examples $\to$ learn category 
  - strengths: art, mechanical abilities
- Pattern Thinker
  -  learning approach: require stretching, putting out of comfort zone
  - learning mistake: over-protecting
  - strengths: math, CS, music
- Verbal Facts Thinker
  - facts, history
- Auditory Thinker
